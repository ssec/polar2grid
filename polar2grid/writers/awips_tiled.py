"""The AWIPS Tiled writer is used to create AWIPS compatible tiled NetCDF4 files.

The Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) is a
program used by the United States National Weather Service (NWS) and
others to display and analyze data relevant to meteorology.
Sectorized Cloud and Moisture Imagery (SCMI) is a NetCDF4
format accepted by AWIPS to store one image broken up
into one or more "tiles". This format has been used to support additional
products over time and so this writer is now called "awips_tiled" to refer
to the generic usse of these files. Once AWIPS is configured for specific products
the AWIPS Tiled writer can be used to provide compatible products to the
system. The files created by this writer are compatible with AWIPS II.

The writer takes remapped image data and creates an
AWIPS-compatible NetCDF4 file. The writer and the AWIPS client may
need to be configured to make things appear the way the user wants in
the AWIPS client. The writer can only produce files for datasets mapped
to areas with specific projections:

    - Lambert Conformal Conic (`+proj=lcc`)
    - Geostationary (`+proj=geos`)
    - Mercator (`+proj=merc`)
    - Polar Stereographic (`+proj=stere`)

This is a limitation of the AWIPS client and not of the writer.

Numbered versus Lettered Grids
------------------------------

By default the writer will save tiles by number starting with '1'
representing the upper-left image tile. Tile numbers then increase
along the column and then on to the next row.

By specifying ``--letters`` on the command line, tiles can be designated with a
letter. Lettered grids or sectors are preconfigured in the writer
configuration file (``awips_tiled.yaml`` in SatPy). The lettered tile locations are
static and will not change with the data being written to them. Each lettered
tile is split in to a certain number of subtiles (`--letter-subtiles`),
default 2 rows by 2 columns. Lettered tiles are meant to make it easier for
receiving AWIPS clients/stations to filter what tiles they receive; saving
time, bandwidth, and space.

Tiles (numbered or lettered) not containing any valid data are not
created.

 .. warning::

     The writer does not default to using any grid. Therefore, it is recommended to specify
     one or more grids for remapping by using the `-g` flag.

For more detailed information on templates and other options for this writer
see the Satpy documentation :mod:`here <satpy.writers.awips_tiled>`.

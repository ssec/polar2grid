"""The ABI Level 2 Reader operates on NOAA Level 2 (L2) NetCDF files
from the GOES-16 (GOES-East) and GOES-17 (GOES-West) Advanced Baseline
Imager (ABI) instrument. The ABI L2 NetCDF reader works off of the input
filenames to determine if a file is supported by Geo2Grid. Files usually have
the following naming scheme:

    OR_ABI-L2-{PROD}F-M3_G16_s20182531700311_e20182531711090_c20182531711149.nc

These are the mission compliant radiance file naming conventions
used by the NOAA Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship
System (CLASS) archive and the CSPP Geo AIT Framework Level 2 software.
The ABI L2 NetCDF reader supports most L2 products, but Geo2Grid is tested with
a limited subset of these. See the table below for more information.
The ABI L2 NetCDF reader can be provided to the main geo2grid.sh script
using the ``-r`` option and the reader name ``abi_l2_nc``.

| **Product Name**          | **Description**                                     |

    """Utility class for converting internal Satpy names to user-facing Polar2Grid names.

    Polar2Grid and Geo2Grid currently only allows users to specify the name of
    products to load as a string. For compatibility with older versions of
    Polar2Grid or for basic aesthetic differences, Polar2Grid sometimes has
    different names for products. There are also cases where Polar2Grid needs
    to provide a single name for a more complex Satpy product that normally
    requires a `DataID`.

    This class provides the ability to convert between these different forms
    of naming. If a user provides a Satpy name then this class will **not**
    replace it with a P2G alias (if it exists). This should lead to the least
    amount of surprises for users.

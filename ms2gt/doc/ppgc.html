<h3> Introduction</h3>
 Satellite remote sensing has made possible the collection of data over large
areas of the Earth. These data are often stored in "grids." Grids are an
efficient means of storing data because the location of a value within the
grid is implicit--it is not explicitly stored in the grid. The location is
also constant, which makes it easy to compare data from different sensors
or different time periods. 
<p>&nbsp;The purpose of this document is to give a brief introduction to mapping,
gridding, and the associated terminology used in the mapx library at NSIDC.
Along with comments in the source code, it also describes the format of the
map and grid parameter files. </p>
<p><a name="maps"></a> </p>
<h3> Maps</h3>
 A map projection is a procedure or mathematical formula to transform a curved
surface onto a plane. The curved surface is usually the surface of the Earth
and the plane is what we call a "map." The derivation of a map transformation
requires a mathematical representation of the surface of the Earth. The surface
of constant geopotential referred to as mean sea level or the geoid is quite
complicated and its mathematical form is correspondingly complex. When defining
map projections then, it is common to approximate the surface of the earth
with a simpler surface such as an ellipsoid or sphere. 
<p>&nbsp;The ellipsoid is flattened at the poles, relative to the sphere,
by about 1 part in 300. For maps of large areas (continents or bigger) using
the sphere introduces no significant error. When mapping smaller areas it
is not uncommon to choose an ellipsoid specifically for each area; each area 
is mapped on an ellipsoid with a different radius and eccentricity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Coordinates for points on the surface of the Earth are given in latitude
and longitude. Geodetic latitude is the angle between a vertical ray at the
point and the plane of the equator. Geocentric latitude is the angle between
a ray from the center of the Earth to the point and the plane of the equator.
On a sphere, the geodetic latitude is equivalent to the geocentric latitude.
It's more common to use geodetic latitude. There is only one definition of
longitude--the angle between a ray from the center of the Earth to the point
and the plane of the Greenwich Meridian (an arbitrary reference point). Coordinates
in the map plane (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) are defined in the usual manner with
<i>x</i> horizontal and increasing to the right and <i>y</i> vertical and
increasing upward.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><a name="projections"></a> </p>
<h3> Projections</h3>
 <img src="mprojex.gif">
 
<p>&nbsp;Map transformations are referred to as projections because they are
commonly visualized as geometric constructs. That is, we think of the map
as a piece of paper wrapped around a globe with lines emanating from points
on the globe and "projected" onto the paper. It's important to note that
not all map projections can be constructed in this manner. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Map projections are specified as a set of equations giving <i>x</i> 
and <i>y</i> in terms of <i>latitude</i> and <i>longitude</i>. The manner 
in which we wrap the paper around the globe determines the form of the equations.
Cylindrical projections wrap the paper around in a tube, conical projections
use a cone, and azimuthal projections use a flat surface. Several parameters
are used in these equations to specify exactly where the surface intersects
the globe, the scale or size of the globe, and the translation and rotation
of the map on the plane surface. </p>
<p>&nbsp;There is no one best map projection. Each projection has different 
properties and different "best" uses. Two of the most important characteristics 
of maps are whether they are conformal or equal-area. No map projection is
both, and some are neither. If a map is conformal then angles within a small
area are reproduced accurately. This means that shapes are preserved. A small
circle on the globe will look like a small circle on the map. In formal terms,
at any point on the map the scale <i>h</i> along a meridian of longitude
is equal to the scale <i>k</i> along a parallel of latitude. If a map is
equal-area then a small circle placed anywhere on the map will always cover
the same amount of area on the globe and the product of <i>h</i> and <i>k</i>
at any point is one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;For maps that are not equal-area, <i>hk</i> - 1 gives a measure
of the areal distortion. For maps that are not conformal, <i>k</i>/<i>h</i>
gives the aspect ratio, which is a measure of shape distortion. For example, 
on the Polar Stereographic map true at 70N (a conformal map) the areal distortion
varies from -6% at the pole to +29% at 45N and goes up to +276% at the equator
while, by definition, the aspect ratio remains 1:1 everywhere. The Azimuthal
Equal-Area map over the pole has, of course, no areal distortion, while the
aspect ratio varies from 1:1 at the pole to 1.17:1 at 45N and goes up to
2:1 at the equator. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Tissot's indicatrix combines the two previous measures. Tissot's 
indicatrix is a small ellipse which shows both the scale distortion and the
maximum angular deformation at a particular point on the map. See <a
 href="#references">Maling</a> or <a href="#references">Snyder</a> for a
complete discussion. </p>
<p><a name="grids"></a> </p>
<h3> Grids</h3>
 A grid is a rectangular array of points. Grids record regularly spaced samples
over an area. When sampling over the surface of the earth a grid is determined
by a map projection, a sampling interval, an origin, and the number of rows
and columns. So called "lat/lon" or "equal angle" grids are equivalent to
grids sampled on a Cylindrical Equidistant map projection.
<p>  A grid coordinate system is defined in the map plane with axes parallel
to the rows and columns of the grid and units equal to the sampling interval.
The grid sample locations are at the whole integer grid coordinate points.
To conform to mathematical array conventions, the grid coordinates (<i>r</i>,<i>s</i>)
start at (0,0) in the upper left corner with <i>r</i> increasing to the right,
and <i>s</i> increasing downward (this also conforms to digital image processing
conventions). A grid cell (<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>) is defined as the area between
grid coordinates <i>i</i>-.5 and <i>i</i>+.5, and <i>j</i>-.5 and <i>j</i>+.5.
To conform to rounding conventions, the lower bound is included in the cell
while the upper bound is not (round up at .5).  Note that the <i>r</i> coordinate 
corresponds to the grid column number <i>j</i>, and the <i>s</i> coordinate
corresponds to the grid row number <i>i</i>.</p>
<p>  Think of the grid as a map drawn on graph paper. To find a grid cell
location, count graph lines over from the left and down from the top, then
read the latitude and longitude off the map. </p>

<p><a name="binning"></a> </p>
<h3> Binning</h3>
 The process of sampling data on a grid is sometimes referred to as binning,
especially when the sampling method is to average all data that falls into
the grid cell. Other methods used to sample data are: take the closest value
to the grid point (nearest neighbor) or interpolate between surrounding grid
points.  Also, binning doesn't need to be the average of multiple data points;
it could be the minimum, the maximum, the median, or the latest value in
the grid cell. The characteristics of the data should determine the sampling
method. <br>
<br>
<a name="pictures"></a> 
<h3> Pictures</h3>
 Pixels are analogous to grid cells. To display gridded data as a picture, 
define a transformation from grid coordinates to pixel coordinates and then
sample the gridded data at the whole integer pixel coordinate points. The
most common technique is to map grid cells onto pixels one for one. More
sophisticated techniques, often referred to as "resampling", allow for scrolling,
zooming, and rotating. <br>
<br>
<a name="parameters"></a> 
<h3> Parameters</h3>
 Many programs we use at NSIDC depend on the "mapx" module to handle map projections.
These include: GISMO, PSQ, regrid, gridomatic, and the EASE-Grid processing
software. Most of these tools provide access to predefined maps, but, it
is relatively easy to define your own map with a map projection parameters
(.mpp) file. <br>
&nbsp;  
<h3> <a name="mpp"></a>Map Projection Parameters (.mpp) File Format</h3>
 Each parameter is described by a "keyword: value" pair on a single line. 
A colon must delimit the end of a keyword without any intervening spaces, 
tabs, or newlines. Keywords are not case sensitive. Parameters can be followed 
by comments, which begin with a semi-colon (;) or a pound sign (#): all text
following a semi-colon or a pound sign on a particular line is ignored. Parameters
can appear in any order. The default value is used when the corresponding
keyword is not found. Unrecognized keywords are silently ignored. This means
that if you misspell a keyword you'll get the default value without warning.
The following parameters define the map projection for all projections except
<a href="#isin">Integerized Sinusoidal</a> and <a href="#utm">Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM)</a>. <br>

 Keywords must be entered verbatim. Capitalization doesn't matter but white
space does. Unrecognized (or mispelled) keywords are silently ignored. Map
names are not case sensitive, white space and dashes are ignored, and most
word permutations are acceptable. For example, "Equal-Area Cylindrical" is
equivalent to "CYLINDRICAL EQUALAREA". 
<p>&nbsp;The reference latitude and longitude specify the original location 
and orientation of the map projection. The origin of the rectangular map coordinate
system can be rotated and translated with the Rotation and Origin keywords.
Note that a positive rotation value will rotate the coordinate system <i>counter-clockwise</i>
around the translated map origin. This will have the effect of rotating the
resulting grid of pixel values <i>clockwise</i> with respect to the grid
that would be obtained if the rotation value were 0. </p>
<p><a name="second_latitude"></a>For the Cylindrical Equal-Area, and Polar 
Stereographic projections, the second reference latitude specifies the latitude
of "true" scale. Conceptually, this is where the projection plane intersects 
the surface. For the Albers Conic Equal-Area and Lambert Conic Conformal projections,
the conic plane is secant to the surface between the reference latitude and
the second reference latitude. </p>
<p>&nbsp;The equatorial radius and eccentricity specify the surface to be
mapped (usually the Earth's surface). Alternatively, the square of the eccentricity
rather than the eccentricity may be specified; or both the equatorial radius
and the polar radius may be specified rather than either the eccentricity
or the square of the eccentricity; or the polar radius and either the eccentricity
or the square of the eccentricity map be specified rather than the equatorial
radius. The scale and the equatorial radius determine the map units. For
example if the radius is in kilometers (as is the case with the default)
and the scale is 1.0, then the map units will be kilometers. For spherical
projections, the eccentricity should not be specified, and the default equatorial
radius is 6371.228, i.e. the authalic sphere equivalent to the Clark ellipsoid
in km. For elliptical projections, the default eccentricity is 0.082271673
and the default equatorial radius is 6378.2064, i.e. the Clark 1866 ellipsoid
in km. For the WGS-84 ellipsoid in meters, use 0.081819190843 for the eccentricity
and 6378137.0 for the equatorial radius. PostScript units are inches, so
for PostScript output you would specify the scale in kilometers per inch.
For a grid you can define the scale in terms of kilometers per grid cell.
The gridding module "grids" also has parameters which specify grid cells
per map unit or, alternatively, map units per grid cell. This allows the
same .mpp file to be used for multiple nested grids. </p>
<p>Map Origin Latitude and Longitude specify the translated map origin. By
default the map origin is the same as the reference latitude and longitude. 
Alternatively, the translated map origin can be specified by Map Origin X
and Y, which take precedence over any specification of the Map Origin Latitude
or Longitude. Both Map Origin X and Y must be specified if either is specified.
If Map Rotation is specified, then the rotation is centered on the translated
map origin. Furthermore, the specification of Grid Map Column and Row values
in the <a href="#gpd">Grid Parameter Definition File</a> will locate the
translated map origin at the specified column and row location within the
grid. </p>
<p>False easting and false northing offsets are applied to the x and y map
coordinates, respectively, with respect to the original map origin specified
by the reference latitude and longitude. Note that Map Origin X and Y specify
values <i>after</i> false easting and false northing offsets have been applied. 
</p>
<p>The center scale value is used only by the Transverse Mercator projection 
(and for the <a href="#utm">UTM</a> projection as well). It specifies the 
scale factor along the central meridian. </p>
<p>&nbsp;The remaining parameters are used by programs that actually draw 
maps (e.g. psmap, mapenum). The southern, northern, western, and eastern bounds
of the map are the starting point for the graticule and are used to speed
up the search in the map outline database. They cannot be counted on to clip
the map accurately. All longitudes should be in the range -180 to +360. West
to east should not span more than 360 degrees. West specifies the left side
of the map and east the right, not necessarily the minimum and maximum longitudes. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;The latitude and longitude graticule intervals specify the spacing 
between graticule lines. The graticule is the overlay of latitude and longitude 
lines on the map. By default, a parallel is drawn every 30 degrees starting 
at the bottom of the map (90.00S) and a meridian is drawn every 30 degrees 
starting at the left side of the map (180.00W). Label latitude and longitude 
specify the parallel and meridian along which to draw the graticule line labels. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;The last three numbers are used by the database search routine to
specify the level of detail for map lines. The level refers to the number 
and size of features which will be selected, as opposed to resolution of
each feature. The higher the number, the more detail will be included. For
example, level 1 will include only the largest features, such as whole continents,
while level 2 would also include some smaller features like large lakes.
In either case the continental outline will appear with the same amount of
detail (the same jaggedness). <br>

<p>For the ISin projection all map projection parameters have the same definitions
as described <a href="#mpp">above</a> with the following exceptions. </p>
<p>For the ISin projection, the Map Reference Latitude parameter value is
forced to 0.0; any Map Reference Latitude value supplied by the user is ignored.
The Map Reference Longitude parameter is not required for the ISin projection;
the default value is 0.0. </p>
<p>The Map ISin NZone parameter is used only by the ISin projection; it specifies
the number of equally spaced latitudinal zones (i.e. "rows"), and must be
2 or larger and even. Note that this value is a characteristic of the projection
only and is independent of the actual number of rows in any grid that utilizes
the ISin projection. Also note that currently only the default value of 86400
is used by all ECS MODIS products (including all 1000 m, 500 m, and 250 m
products) based on the ISin projection. </p>
<p>The Map ISin Justify parameter is used only by the ISin projection; it
is used to indicate what to do with zones with an odd number of columns. If
it has a value of 0 or 1, it indicates the extra column is on the right (zero)
or left (one) of the projection y-axis. If the flag is set to 2, the number
of columns is calculated so there is always an even number of columns in
each zone. Note that currently only the default value of 1 is used by all
ECS MODIS products based on the ISin projection. </p>
<p>By default, setting Map Projection to Integerized Sinusoidal specifies 
a spherical projection using a radius of 6371007.181 meters. Note that this
value is currently used for all ECS MODIS products based on the ISin projection.
Only a spherical projection is supported for the ISin projection. </p>

<p>For the UTM projection all map projection parameters have the same definitions 
as described <a href="#mpp">above</a> with the following exceptions. </p>
<p>The UTM zone value is used only by the UTM projection. Zones are in the
range 1 to 60 for the northern hemisphere, and -1 to -60 for the southern 
hemisphere. If the UTM zone is 0, then the hemisphere and absolute value of
the zone are determined by the reference latitude and longitude, respectively. 
If the UTM zone is not 0, then the reference latitude and longitude are not
required and are ignored if present. The effective reference latitude value
for every UTM zone is 0 (the equator); the effective reference longitude value
is the central meridian of the zone starting at 177W for zones 1 and -1,
171W for zones 2 and -2, and so on until 177E for zones 60 and -60. Note
that <i>either</i> Map UTM Zone must be non-zero <i>or both</i> Map Reference
Latitude <i>and</i> Map Reference Longitude <i>must</i> be specified. </p>
<p>The default Map Origin Latitude and Longitude values are determined by
the effective reference latitude value, which is always 0, and the effective 
reference longitude value, which is determined from the UTM zone, either as
supplied in the Map UTM Zone value or as derived from the Map Reference Longitude
value. </p>
<p>By default, setting Map Projection to Universal Transverse Mercator specifies
an ellipsoidal projection using the WGS-84 ellipsoid. To specify a spherical
UTM projection, set Map Eccentricity to 0, and set Map Equatorial Radius
to the radius of the sphere in meters. </p>
<p>For the UTM projection, the default false easting is 500000 (five hundred 
thousand) meters. For northern hemisphere UTM zones, the default false northing
is 0 meters, and for southern hemisphere UTM zones, the default false northing
is 10000000 (10 million) meters. Note that these values assume that Map Equatorial
Radius is in meters and that Map Scale is 1.0. Note also that Map Origin
X and Y specify values <i>after</i> false easting and false northing offsets
have been applied. For example, for the UTM projection for a southern hemisphere
UTM zone, specifying a Map Origin X value of 175000 will set the translated
map origin to 325000 (500000 - 175000) meters west of the central meridian
for the UTM zone, and specifying a Map Origin Y value of 5325000 will set
the translated map origin to 4675000 (10000000 - 5325000) meters south of
the equator. </p>
<p>The center scale value specifies the scale factor along the central meridian;
the default for the UTM projection is 0.9996. </p>

<h3> Limitations</h3>
 The mapx library is very flexible but it does impose certain restrictions 
on the kinds of grids that can be defined. All grids must be rectangular arrays.
Rectangular arrays are easy to use with existing scientific visualization 
tools, like IDL, but they may be inefficient in terms of storage space for
non-rectangular data sets. If some flag value (for example zero) is stored
in the unused cells, then this wasted space can be compacted by any good
data compression scheme. This same invalid data flag can be used within the
grid as well, leading to further storage savings. Another restriction is
that each grid must be based on a map projection defined in mapx. Many of
the most useful projections have already been implemented and fortunately 
it is easy, given a mathematical formulation of the forward and inverse transformations,
to add a new projection to mapx (see source code for instructions). The mathematical
formulations of most common map projections can be found in the references
below.&nbsp;<a name="references"></a>

# Simplify compiling CREFL. Compile commands were copied from original files and modified to fit Makefile (see readme).
#
# Example Compile Usage (where static dependencies headers and libaries are in ~/opt/):
#       LDFLAGS="-I ~/opt/include -L ~/opt/lib" make
#
# Example Install Usage (where files will be installed in ~/bin):
#       PREFIX="~" make install
#
# Example Dynamic Compile/Link Usage:
#		make all_dynamic
#
# Example Dynamic Compile/Link Usage (with specialized library locations)
# 		LD_RUN_PATH=/home/user/opt/lib LDFLAGS="-I ~opt/include -L ~/opt/lib" make all_dynamic

Development Environment
=======================

Before adding components to polar2grid you will need to set up a polar2grid
development environment.  This will make it easier to get the newest updates
from other developers and vice versa. Creating a development environment does
not provide the bash wrapper scripts since they depend on a software bundle.
It is recommended that you contact the Polar2Grid team before adding/developing
any new features to coordinate efforts.

The main code repository for polar2grid can be found on github at
https://github.com/ssec/polar2grid.
Changes to this repository are done through a
`pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_
which will require creating a
`fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_ of the repository.

The following instructions will assist in getting an environment up and running
that will allow for easy development of polar2grid. The instructions will use an
existing conda-based Python environment. This isn't strictly required, but is the
easiest way to get going. To avoid possible Terms of Service issues with
Anaconda.org, we recommend using ``miniforge`` or ``mambaforge`` to install
conda on your system. See https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#miniforge
for more information.

1. Get a copy of the code repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

       mkdir ~/polar2grid
       cd ~/polar2grid
       git clone https://github.com/ssec/polar2grid.git
       cd polar2grid


2. Create a conda environment specifically for Polar2Grid/Geo2Grid work:

   .. code-block:: bash

       conda env create -n p2g_dev --file build_environment.yml

    This script will walk you through a few questions including whether or not to use ShellB3 (linux only), provide
    a preinstalled ShellB3, or build and install secondary polar2grid components.

3. Active the conda environment and install "polar2grid" in development mode:

   .. code-block:: bash

       conda activate p2g_dev
       pip install --no-deps -e .

4. Run "polar2grid.sh" or "geo2grid.sh" to run example commands. These scripts
   are made available because you installed the python package above. Any
   changes made to the source code should be automatically reflected when you
   run these scripts. There are also "polar2grid" and "geo2grid" helper
   scripts when on non-bash environments. All of these scripts are simple
   wrappers around calling `python -m polar2grid.glue ...` which can be used
   as an alternative.

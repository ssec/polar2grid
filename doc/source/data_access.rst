Data Access
===========

Geo2Grid software is designed with the direct broadcast community
in mind as the target end user.  However, the software can be used
by anyone to create images from standard mission compliant input
files. NOAA GOES-16 and GOES-17 ABI data is now freely
available through Amazon Web Services (AWS). More information about
accessing data can be found at this website:

    https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-goes/

And a very nice interface that allows direct downloads from
the AWS can be found here:
